      <h1>How backup and branch using Git and Github!</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>create a directory (mkdir 'name')</li>
        <li>move into the directory (cd 'dir name')</li>
        <li>initialize Git in your folder, initial commit (git init)</li>
        <li>create your html, css, js files (touch 'filename')</li>
        <li>git add . then git commit. This is yor initail commit</li>
        <li>next create the remote repo (git remote add origin git@github.com:Muffinman75/branch-practice.git:Muffinman75/'folder name'.git</li>
        <li>set up github repo to track local one (git push -u origin master, only git push there on after.)</li>
        <li>work on your project, saving and pushing as you go,
           til a point is reached when you need to branch because the changes
         you wish to make are deep. Now it's time to branch!</li>

        <li>create and switch to a branch (git checkout -b 'branch-name')</li>
        <li>work and add the feature required without the fear that you will
        break your existing code, Hooray!</li>
        <li>when you are happy your feature will not break your code, it's time to merge!</li>
        <li>IMPORTANT! first move back into your master branch (git checkout master)</li>
        <li>use (git diff 'branch-name') to check the differences between the branches</li>
        <li>try a merge with (git merge --no-f 'branch-name')</li>
        <li>take care of any merge conflicts (decide code to implement, code to discard, discuss with collaborators)</li>
        <li>branch can then be deleted if desired (git branch -d 'branch-name')</li>
      </ul>
